            I am in the final year of my MRC-funded PhD programme at King's College London. <br>
            I intend to characterise the changes in structural and functional brain networks which occur during healthy ageing.<br>
            If we know what network changes to expect in healthy ageing, we can better understand the changes that happen when ageing is not healthy.
            <p></p>
            I graduated from the University of Glasgow in 2013 with a BSc(Hons) in neuroscience, having taken modules in human biology, psychology, and chemistry.<br>
            Following a short sabbatical to travel, I moved to London to pursue an MSc in neuroimaging at King's College London, which I graduated with distinction in 2015.<br>
            My PhD has been an excellent opportunity to realise my data skills; I have developed my Bash, Matlab, and Python coding abilities, and gained an enthusiasm for open science and data analysis methods. <p>
